# Air-Quality-Prediction


This project aims to predict AQI (PM 2.5) from several physical factors. The identified ML problem is the regression problem statement wherein we predict a numerical value. 
Several Models where used and the best result was achived with XGBoostRegressor+GridSearchCV. various models are used like Linear & Lasso Regression, DecisionTree Regressor,Random forest Regrssor & XGBoost Regressor. An EDA is also peroformed on the data as well as feature importance.
